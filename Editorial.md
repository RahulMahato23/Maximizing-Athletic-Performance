# Editorial: Maximizing Athletic Performance

## Problem Overview
In this problem, we are given a set of performance scores for different athletic events. The task is to select a subset of non-adjacent events to participate in, with the goal of maximizing the cumulative performance score. However, due to a unique constraint, we cannot participate in consecutive events.

## Approach
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. We will maintain two variables, `include` and `exclude`, which represent the maximum cumulative performance score including and excluding the current event, respectively.

Let's consider the `i`-th event. To compute the maximum cumulative performance score including the `i`-th event, we need to consider two cases:

1. If we include the `i`-th event, we cannot include the previous event (since consecutive events are not allowed). Therefore, the maximum cumulative performance score including the `i`-th event will be the sum of the `i`-th event's performance score and the maximum cumulative performance score excluding the previous event.

2. If we exclude the `i`-th event, we can include or exclude the previous event. Therefore, the maximum cumulative performance score excluding the `i`-th event will be the maximum of the maximum cumulative performance score including and excluding the previous event.

By considering these cases, we can update the `include` and `exclude` variables as we iterate through the events. Finally, the maximum cumulative performance score will be the maximum of the `include` and `exclude` variables after considering all the events.

However, we need to handle a special case where all performance scores are negative. In this case, there are no positive scores available to maximize the cumulative performance. Hence, the maximum possible cumulative performance score will be 0, indicating that the athlete did not participate in any event.

## Pseudocode
```
function maximizePerformance(scores):
    n = length(scores)
    include = scores[0]
    exclude = 0

    for i from 1 to n-1:
        newInclude = max(scores[i] + exclude, include)
        newExclude = max(include, exclude)
        include = newInclude
        exclude = newExclude

    if max(include, exclude) < 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return max(include, exclude)
```

## Time Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of events. This is because we iterate through the events once and perform constant time operations at each step.

## Conclusion
In this problem, we used dynamic programming to maximize the cumulative performance score by selecting non-adjacent events. By considering the constraints and using an efficient algorithm, we were able to find the optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n). This approach handles the special case of all negative performance scores, where the maximum possible cumulative performance score is 0. This solution can be applied to similar problems where we need to select elements with certain constraints to optimize a cumulative metric.
