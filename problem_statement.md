# Problem Statement: Maximizing Athletic Performance

## Description
In the world of athletics, there is an aspiring athlete named Alex who dreams of achieving greatness. Alex is dedicated and trains rigorously to improve their performance in various disciplines. One day, while participating in a multi-event competition, Alex discovered an intriguing challenge that tested their mental and physical abilities.

The challenge was to maximize the overall performance across different events while adhering to a unique constraint. Alex must choose a set of non-adjacent events to participate in, with the goal of maximizing their cumulative performance score. However, due to a special rule, Alex cannot participate in consecutive events.

Alex is determined to find the optimal strategy that will lead to the highest possible performance score. Can you help Alex in this endeavor?

Your task is to write a program that takes in an integer n, representing the number of performance scores, followed by n integers separated by spaces (a1, a2, ..., an), representing the performance scores for different events. The program should return the maximum possible cumulative performance score that can be achieved by participating in non-adjacent events.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- Each ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n) will be an integer representing the performance score, ranging from -10^9 to 10^9.
- It is guaranteed that there will be at least one event.

## Explanation
- Positive performance scores (ai > 0) indicate that the athlete had good past records for that event, and the magnitude of the score reflects the degree of performance. It suggests that the athlete is likely to perform well based on their previous achievements.
- Negative performance scores (ai < 0) represent events where the athlete had poor past records and is likely to perform poorly. It suggests that the athlete has struggled in similar events in the past and may face difficulties.
- Zero performance scores (ai = 0) represent events where the athlete had no prior experience, and therefore, it is uncertain how they will perform. It indicates that the athlete has not participated in such events before and lacks any track record.

## Examples
### Example 1:
Input: 5
        9 -2 6 3 1
Output: 16
Explanation: The maximum cumulative performance score is achieved by participating in events with scores [9, 6, 1]. The sum of these scores is 16.

### Example 2:
Input: 6
        4 2 -8 5 1 9
Output: 18
Explanation: The maximum cumulative performance score is achieved by participating in events with scores [4, 5, 9]. The sum of these scores is 18.

### Example 3:
Input: 6
        -7 5 2 1 -6 4
Output: 10
Explanation: The maximum cumulative performance score is achieved by participating in events with scores [5, 1, 4]. The sum of these scores is 10.

### Example 4:
Input: 4
        -3 -2 -4 -5
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, all performance scores are negative. As no positive scores are available, the maximum possible cumulative performance score is 0, indicating that the athlete did not participate in any event.

Note: The athlete can choose non-adjacent events to maximize their cumulative performance score. Your task is to implement a program efficiently to solve the problem and find the maximum possible cumulative performance score. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one event, and the minimum possible output is 0 in case of all negative performance scores.
